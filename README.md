# React + Vite

Hi Team,

I'm not very familiar with TypeScript as my experience has mostly been with JavaScript. While I don't know all the concepts of TypeScript, I gave my best effort to create the Todo app. You can check the Netlify hosted URL to evaluate its performance. I used local storage to store and display the todo data. I'm committed to learning TypeScript if it's required for the project.

Thank you.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
